# Simple Linear Regression implementation in Python
This repository contains the python implementation for Simple Linear Regression in two different ways:
1. From scratch using NumPy 
2. Using Scikit-learn library

## Data
I have used employees salary data. This data have one feature named 'YearsExperience' and the output variable named as 'Salary'. 
  - We have to predict the salary of an employee based on the years of experience.

## Notebooks
There are two notebooks with step-by-step implementation:
* `Simple_Linear_Regression_Using_Numpy.ipynb` : Simple linear regression implemented with Numpy
* `Simple_Linear_Regression_Using_Scikit-Learn.ipynb` : Simple linear regression implemented with Scikit-learn

## Additional `.py` files
* `model/Simple_LR_NumPy.py` : Simple LR code implemented in Numpy
* `utils/metrices.py` : Python implementation for mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared 
* `utils/utils.py` : Functions to save and load the model
